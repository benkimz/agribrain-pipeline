The GVCBMC developed a traceability system to comply with the tracking and origin of the product. The condition of perishability of blueberry forces the traders to have conservation means. The traceability label from the trader is placed on the clamshells. The trader sends blueberry to the distributor from different authorized producers. The pallets are transported to the Guadalajara airport in closed, refrigerated and clean vehicles, equipped with devices that measure the variations in temperature and light during transport.
