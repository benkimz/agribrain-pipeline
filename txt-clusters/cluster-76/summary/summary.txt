Current pricing signals for lamb are encouraging the supply of lambs at heavier weights. The ideal domestic lamb specification for consumers is around 22 kg. The domestic market absorbs approximately 40 per cent of lamb supply. In the export market, heavier carcase weights intended for the U.S. range from 20 to 30 kg.
