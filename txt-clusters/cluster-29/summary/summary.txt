The global trend in animal production indicates a rapid and massive increase in the consumption of livestock products. Meat and milk consumption is predicted to grow at 2.8 and 3.3% per annum in developing countries like India. In 2006-07, this sector contributed 101 million tonnes of milk, 51 billion eggs, 45 million kg wool and 2.3 million tons of meat. The data/estimates of fodder production in the country vary widely. The regional deficits are more important than the national deficit, especially for fodder.
