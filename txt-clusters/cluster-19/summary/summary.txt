In Sub-Saharan Africa, growing both domesticated and wild fruit tree species on farms diversifies the crop production options of small-scale farmers and can bring significant health, ecological and economic revenues. Women are often involved in and benefit from fruit processing and trade, especially with regard to indigenous fruits. African farmers have utilized wild browse or trees that grow naturally on their farms to feed their livestock for centuries. Fodder tree/shrub legumes have the potential to provide feed during dry season.
