Consumers are interested in the health and nutritional aspects of meat products. Consumers are willing to pay more for meat products that have been produced naturally, taking into account high standards and animal welfare. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of sex on the growth performance, carcass traits and meat quality of Ross 308 broiler chickens reared in an organic system. Males had a better growth and slaughter performance than females. The meat quality traits and fat content were also affected by sex.
