There are acute and chronic labour shortages in the Australian agricultural sector. Agricultural industries need to invest in strategies to address chronic workforce shortages and emerging skills gaps. Automatic cluster removers (ACRs) are a popular device used for reducing labour requirements and improving conditions for workers and cows in the milking shed. Economic analysis suggests ACRs could be a good investment in many Australian dairies with a nominal internal rate of return (IRR) of up to 75%.
