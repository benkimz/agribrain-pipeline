Sugarcane is one of the key agricultural export commodities in the Rwandan economy, but sugarcane yields in Rwanda have remained low. The study aimed at determining socio-economic factors influencing sugar cane production along River Nyabarongo in Rwanda. It found that cost of land preparation, planting, fertilizers, transport and cooperative functioning fees were found to affect sugar cane Production at 5% and 10% levels of significance respectively. It recommends that policies and strategies should be formulated to encourage contract participation and expand the area under sugarcanes.
