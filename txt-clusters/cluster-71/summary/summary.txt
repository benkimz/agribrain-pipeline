In the precipitation-driven erosion process, soil or other materials are first dislodged from the ground, and then swept up by the flow of sheet runoff water across the ground surface. Erosion increases rapidly when vegetation and the intact duff or organic outer layer of soil are removed. Developed land generates more runoff than undeveloped land. Land erosion due to stormwater runoff from developed land can be mitigated using traditional stormwater management practices and Low Impact Development (LID) and Green Infrastructure practices.
