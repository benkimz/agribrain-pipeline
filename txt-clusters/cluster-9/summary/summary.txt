Tomato is one of the most commonly grown vegetables in Malawi. A field survey was conducted in six major tomato growing districts in the northern region, Dowa, Lilongwe, Dedza and Ntcheu in central region and Thyolo in southern region in May, 2020. The survey identified four major production constraints: pests, diseases, marketing and input cost, and the major constraint is price fluctuations.
