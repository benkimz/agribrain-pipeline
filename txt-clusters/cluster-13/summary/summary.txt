Arabica coffee originated from the mountain forests of Ethiopia. Arabica is grown in tropical regions with an altitude of over 500m. It takes around 2.5 months for the flower buds to develop into flowers on 1-year-old wood. The conversion of light and CO2 into sugar takes place in the leaves and in the roots. Coffee plants also produce hormones.
