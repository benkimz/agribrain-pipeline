The aim of the collection is to help in the systematic study of pests, diseases and weeds and to obtain experience in correctly identifying the causes of plant problems. About 20 specimens should be prepared for each collection. It is a good idea to swap specimens with other collectors. Some insects are nuisance pests. Some biting pests pierce the skin to feed on blood and some bite the skin.
