Soil erosion due to irrigation can range from none to over 30 tons per acre per year on furrow-irrigated fields. Polyacrylamide (PAM) is a long-chain synthetic polymer that acts as a strengthening agent, binding soil particles together. PAM applied in the irrigation water reduced soil erosion in furrows by over 95 percent.
