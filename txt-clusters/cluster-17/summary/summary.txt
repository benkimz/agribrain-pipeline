A survey of beef cattle producers in Missouri was conducted to evaluate the management and production practices of the beef cattle industry. The majority of producers were between ages 31 and 55, and 63.0% had a Bachelor or Graduate degree. Producers who attend grazing school were more likely to use temporary electric fencing to rotate cattle during the growing season, stockpile forage, move cattle frequently and utilize more stockpiled winter forage. Net profit was positively correlated to number of mature cattle.
