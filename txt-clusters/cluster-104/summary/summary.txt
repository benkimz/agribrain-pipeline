There are about 34 seedling nursery facilities installed in the southern districts of Lesotho to supply seedlings to farmers. The nurseries have not been able to meet the country's domestic seedling needs due to extreme climatic events, mainly hail, frost and temperature borne diseases. It has been projected that cold fronts will be more frequent and more severe under climate change conditions.
