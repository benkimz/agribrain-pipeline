Genetically engineered crops are digested by animals in the same way as conventional crops. There are no significant differences in the nutritional value of feedstuffs derived from commercially grown genetically engineered crops compared with their conventional counterparts. Genetically engineered DNA has never been detected in milk, meat, or eggs from animals fed genetically engineered feed. The presence of plant-derived DNA fragments in animal tissues is a natural process.
