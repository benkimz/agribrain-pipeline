Livestock farming has undergone a significant transformation in the past few decades. Most meat and dairy products are produced on large farms with single species buildings or open-air pens. Modern farms have become much more efficient. Since 1960, milk production has doubled, meat production has tripled, and egg production has quadrupled. CAFOs are classified by the type and number of animals they contain and the way they discharge waste into the water supply. They have a direct impact on human health and welfare for communities that contain them.
