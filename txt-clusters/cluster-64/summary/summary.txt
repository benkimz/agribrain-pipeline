In the Beef CRC, Sustainable Beef Profit Partnership (BPP) teams meet regularly to measure their current performance, set targets for future productivity increases, and use a profitability framework to assess the potential impact of improvements, innovations and new technologies in their beef businesses. BPP teams are supported with appropriate tools and resources. In the beef industry, as in many agricultural industries in Australia, there are few capacity building opportunities.
