Read and follow safety procedures in the manufacturer's manual. Make sure an approved cab or rollover protective structure (ROPS) is fitted and use a seatbelt on tractors with ROPs. Always mount and dismount on the left side of the tractor. Take short breaks regularly when working long hours. Watch for overhead powerlines.
