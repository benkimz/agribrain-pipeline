Temperate forests occupy about a quarter of the world's forests and are present to a great extent in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and Australia. They provide timber and non-timber resources, but they have been reduced due to increased land degradation. The government has responded to this situation through reforestation and soil conservation programs managed by the Comisin Nacional Forestal.
