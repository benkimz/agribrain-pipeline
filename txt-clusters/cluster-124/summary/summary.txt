Ethiopian indigenous chickens have a variety of morphological appearances. They have low productivity due to low hatchability at about 70% and high mortality. The modern broiler reaches slaughter weight within several weeks. Modern broiler chicks are vaccinated against several different diseases. The most common vaccines used are against Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, coccidiosis, avian pneumovirus, infectious bursal disease and Mareks disease.
