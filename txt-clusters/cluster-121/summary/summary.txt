This pamphlet gives an overview of the role and methods used for current conventional feed analyses, followed by a description of more recent techniques and their possible application to less developed country feeding systems. Chemical assays are increasingly being applied to the evaluation of anti-nutritive factors particularly tannins. Near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique increasingly being used for rapid analysis and quality control.
