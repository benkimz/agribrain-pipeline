The study followed a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA method. 54 articles from the academic literature on urban agriculture were analyzed. The focus of the literature was on the agriculture model, country socio-economic context, opportunities, and challenges. People in developed countries tend to favor social, health-related, educational and educational benets of urban agriculture. In developing countries, urban agriculture is more related to economic and ecological needs. Challenges for urban agriculture are different among developed and developing countries. Academic studies need to be more holistic.
