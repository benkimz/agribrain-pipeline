Indigenous chicken are the most abundant livestock in many rural and peri-urban households in Kenya. They convert feed resources available in the homestead or household into valuable protein products. Their output in terms of weight gain and number of eggs per hen per year is low, but it is obtained with minimal labour and other inputs. Significant returns can be achieved from indigenous chicken without expensive housing, complex technology and funding.
