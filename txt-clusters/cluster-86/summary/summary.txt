Beetroot is a horticultural crop that needs intensive cultural practice. A field experiment was conducted in the 2012 to study the effects of plant spacing and urea fertilization on yield and yield components of Deteroit dark red beetroot cultivars. Spacing at highest level (30*25cm) with lowest level of urea (45gm/plot) was found to be optimum for maximizing yield of beetroot.
