The potential net benefits of pasture species with enhanced genetic potential can be estimated using the acquisition value technique. Alfalfa mosaic virus resistance (AMV Res) and summer survival through delayed leaf senescence (SS) in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) are valued using the technique. Pasture intake from two contrasting dairy farm experiments in temperate Australia was used to estimate the potential economic benefit of changes in the ME concentration of pasture consumed by lactating dairy cows.
