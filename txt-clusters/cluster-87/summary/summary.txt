Immediate and thorough postharvest cooling to remove excessive field-heat aids greatly in maintaining quality and substantially lengthens the shelf-life of tomatoes. Cooling and washing can reduce the effects of dehydration and minimize decay. Pink or light red tomatoes destined for distant markets should be cooled immediately after harvest to avoid becoming overripe before reaching the consumer. Tomatoes are a good source of vitamins A and C.
