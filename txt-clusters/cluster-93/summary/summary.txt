A study looked at the possible impact of different prices of carbon on farm profitability in two dairy farm businesses with different feeding systems. The main finding was that net present value of operating profit for each system over the five years was reduced by a price on carbon. A carbon charge of $25/t CO2-eq reduced profits by around 11% in the RM and 10% in CF systems.
