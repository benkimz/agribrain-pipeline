Ostrich eggs were traded all over the Mediterranean. The first commercial ostrich farm was established in South Africa in 1865. Ostrich farms spread to other countries, particularly Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Argentina. The trade in ostrich feathers declined after the First World War, but the industry survived on a smaller scale.
