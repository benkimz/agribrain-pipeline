PaceLine deboning is based on a conveyor belt transporting carcass portions through the cutting room. The speed of the belt determines the pace of the work on the line. The deboned meat is fed into crates and transported for storage, packing, or further processing. Marel offers a range of batching systems, such as the Multihead Weigher, SpeedBatcher or TargetBatcher.
