There are no commercial snail farms in Africa, so this Agrodok focuses on the farming potential of the giant Afri-can land snails (GALS). The species originated in the coastal regions of East Africa and spread by the 19th century into Southern Ethiopia, Southern Somalia, and Northern Mozambique. They lay several batches of eggs each year and are easy to care for.
