In Mexico, the first ostrich farm was established in 1988. The main client was the government that acquired ostriches to distribute them among a large number of new farmers. The market demand response was overestimated and the farmers ventured into the activity without adequate knowledge bases, infrastructure, and institutional support. Ostrich aroused the interest of investors due to its productive qualities and integral use of the specie.
