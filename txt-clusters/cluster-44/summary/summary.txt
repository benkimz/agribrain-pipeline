The smallholder tea sub-sector makes an important contribution in the Kenyan economy. The subsector has enjoyed growth in terms of acreage, output and number of growers, but productivity has remained low. The study used survey data of a random sample of 525 tea farming households collected from two leading production regions in Kenya. It found that location specific heterogeneities, farm size, the intensity of family labor applied in tea farming, access to extension through the farmer field schools, credit utilization and the tea marketing arrangements have significant influence on tea productivity.
