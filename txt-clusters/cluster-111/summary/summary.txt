Maize is the major crop in the United States, occupying double the area of any other crop. It covers more than 40% of the world and most of it is used as livestock feed. In sub-humid and semi-arid regions in Africa and Latin America it is a staple crop and a major complement of the diet based on the traditional root crops like cassava, sweet potatoes and yams. In South-East Asia the importance of maize as a food crop is overruled by rice.
