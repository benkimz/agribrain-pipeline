There are two types of tree seedlings available: bare root and containerized. Bare root seedlings are grown in nursery beds for several years, lifted and packaged for shipment without soil attached. Containerized seedlings grow in a greenhouse in special-ized paper or plastic containers. It's very important to keep root systems moist during the planting process.
