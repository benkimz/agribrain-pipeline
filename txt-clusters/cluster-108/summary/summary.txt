Planting pits increase crop yields by a combination of moisture conservation and harvesting of runoff from the spaces between the pits. The most famous pitting system is the zay system used in Burkina Faso. It consists of dig-ging holes to a depth of 515 cm. Manure and different kinds of grass are mixed with some of the soil and used to form a small dike.
