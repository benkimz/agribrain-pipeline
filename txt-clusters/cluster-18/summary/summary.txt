A fish pond is one of the several fish production units used in fish farming to grow fish for profit. This extension booklet spells out guidelines for the commercial production of the Tilapia in ponds for farmers in Rwanda. The pond should be greater than 400 m2. Small ponds water depth should be 6o cm to 90 cm. Big ponds should be at least 75 cm to 75 cm. The banks should be 50 cm higher than the water level on the top. Water quality should be monitored regularly to find out the condition of the fish.
