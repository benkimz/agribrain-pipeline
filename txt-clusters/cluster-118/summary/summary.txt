Philippine exports of fruits and coconut oil were growing, but there is little arable land for expansion of production. Technology and increased inputs account for much of the increase in production. Public sector research is one source of this technology, but government invest-ments have been stagnant or declining. Private firms spent $10.5 million on agricultural research in 1995.
