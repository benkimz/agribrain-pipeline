Soil scientists measure soil biological health in terms of microbial biomass, microbial communities, and rate of organic matter decomposition. Soil erosion reduces soil productivity and can cause water and air pollution. Minimizing soil erosion is critical for sustainable agricultural production. Top layer of soil has properties that are more favorable for crop production than the lower layers.
