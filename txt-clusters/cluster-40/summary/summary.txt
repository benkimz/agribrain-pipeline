The Nyangores River is threatened by pollution, deforestation, and poor farming practices. The WRUA is trying to improve the water quality of the river by introducing soil and water conservation measures on 314 farms around three villages in the Nyangore's tributary: Bilelga, Keteremo and Matarmat. The biggest immediate success is that farmers have seen dramatic improvements in the fertility of their farms.
