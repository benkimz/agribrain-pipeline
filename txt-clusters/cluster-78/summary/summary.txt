Calves should be housed individually in outdoor hutches or inside buildings in bedded pens or elevated stalls. They should be provided with dry bedding and protected from drafts. The length of individual stalls should be a little longer than the length of the animal. Pastures and shelters are common in warm humid areas. For stanchions and tie stalls, stall width to length ratio should be at least 0.7.
