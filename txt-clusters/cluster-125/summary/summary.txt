The ancestry of modern cattle can be traced back to a species of wild cattle known as the Aurochs (Bos primigenius). They originated in the Indian subcontinent 250,000 years ago and spread to China, the Middle East, northern Africa and Europe. Robert Bakewell began breeding English Longhorn cattle in 1760. The American Breed was developed by Art Jones on his ranch near Portales in eastern New Mexico.
