According to the study of the state, features and problems of the agricultural land turnover in Ukraine, there is no correlation between the average price of 1 hectare of land and the number of land plots and their size. The inter-disciplinary approach of using economic modelling in LCA is a promising way of relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions usually employed in the LCA literature. We find that the impacts of the modifications are small in terms of the global wheat supply responses, but considerable for land use changes.
